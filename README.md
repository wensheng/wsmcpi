# WSMCPI
Programming Minecraft on the web!

WSMCPI let you communicate with Minecraft with a webpage (through WebSocket)!

(YT video will be added here.)

## Installation
Download or build wsmcpi-1.1X.X.jar, move it to your Spigot/CraftBukkit plugins/ folder.

## Using Embedded Webserver
In your browser's address bar, enter the Spigot server's address, followed by ":8686".  Most likely you are running Spigot locally, so the address should be `localhost:8686`.  Then click `Connect` button on the page to connect.

## Using External Clients
There are 3 examples of client, and they are located in `client/` folder.  They can be used as templates for developing different interfaces that can talk to Minecraft.
